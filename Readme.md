# Jacobi-N-Ways

Languages are the first step in software engineering.
In this project, I am investigating how different languages stack up against each other for the same application.

The goal is to evaluate the ability of the language to express the Jacobi 2-D kernel easily, while still having opportunities for optimizations.

The Jacobi stencil is a common toy application used in high performance computing research to evaluate tools and methods that apply to high performace stencil applications.
This is the kernel that will be developed and optimized in a variety of languages.



Currently, imperative, C-family languages are the main focus, but I'm hoping to branch out into more functional languages.
